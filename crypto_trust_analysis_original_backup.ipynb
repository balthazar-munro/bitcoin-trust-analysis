    "## 9. Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Network Characteristics**:\n",
    "   - The Bitcoin OTC network shows a healthy trust-dominated structure\n",
    "   - J-curve rating distribution indicates typical reputation system behavior\n",
    "   - Majority of ratings are positive (+10), with few distrust ratings\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Trust Anchors (PageRank)**:\n",
    "   - Identified top 10 most trustworthy users based on network influence\n",
    "   - PageRank successfully filters spam ratings by weighing quality over quantity\n",
    "   - These users should be prioritized as trading partners\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Fraud Detection (Community Analysis)**:\n",
    "   - Louvain algorithm detected community structure in the network\n",
    "   - Small, isolated communities flagged as potential Sybil attack rings\n",
    "   - Recommend manual review of suspicious communities\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Trust Path Analysis**:\n",
    "   - Demonstrated ability to assess trading risk based on network connectivity\n",
    "   - Users with no path to trust anchors represent higher risk\n",
    "   - Can be used as pre-trade risk scoring mechanism\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Implement Trust Tiers**:\n",
    "   - Gold Tier: Top 10 PageRank users\n",
    "   - Silver Tier: Users within 2 hops of Gold Tier\n",
    "   - Bronze Tier: All other connected users\n",
    "   - Unverified: Isolated users (require additional verification)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Fraud Monitoring**:\n",
    "   - Flag users in isolated communities for review\n",
    "   - Monitor for sudden community formation (potential new attack)\n",
    "   - Cross-reference with transaction patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **New User Onboarding**:\n",
    "   - Encourage new users to get ratings from established trust anchors\n",
    "   - Provide trust score visibility to help users make informed decisions\n",
    "   - Implement graduated trading limits based on trust tier\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technical Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "- All algorithms handle negative edge weights appropriately\n",
    "- Graph exported to Gephi for advanced visualization\n",
    "- Network can be updated incrementally as new ratings arrive\n",
    "- Algorithms are scalable to larger networks\n",
